# Javascript Notes

Feel free to contribute javascript handmade notes.

Structure each new topic in a seperate folder. I've created a few folders for demo. Feel free to populate them with notes.

Before opening a PR do [read this](..//master/README.md)

Insert the images of notes in this readme.md file via relative paths under appropriate heading and link in the table of contents to it.
No need to insert notes in each topic's sub-topics' readme.md. Just in the topic's folder's main readme.md

## Table of Contents
