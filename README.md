# handwritten-notes

Hello I am Imran Khan:wave:. I created this repository to collect handmade notes :book: which most of us write while studying anything new. 
The aim for doing this is to just help others and make education more accessible:smile:.

## Contribute

It's really simple:

- find the folder about a topic you wish to submit notes for.
- if no folder exists, create a new one with the topic name as the folder name.
- include all images in the folder. 
- also create a readme.md file in the same folder and insert all images using relative paths 
in it in the correct sequence of notes.

>Note: while inserting images in the readme do write an appropriate alt text. [Markdown syntax reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

# Topics

The topics aren't limited. You can contribute notes regarding any topic, any subject, any domain etc.

As of now I've created a few folders to give an idea about how folders need to be structured. Feel free to fill them up with your valuable notes.

For any suggestion, feedback feel free to open an issue.
